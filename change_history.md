- PWA install prompt: gated to mobile devices only (Android/iOS/iPadOS). Hidden on desktop and when app is already installed.
- Geolocation UX: removed auto permission overlay. Location is requested only when pressing the map arrow button. If permission was previously granted, the map auto-centers on load without prompting.
- Performance: tuned geolocation options for faster response (lower timeout, allow cached position, no high-accuracy by default).
- My-location marker: placed/updated when user activates location; auto-centers on load if permission is already granted.
